## Project Description

This project is a server-based Dice Roller web service hosted on **Azure Web Apps** using Node.js. It consists of two main components:

1. **Dice Roller API:**  
   A Node.js/Express application that provides RESTful endpoints to generate random dice rolls and wake up the server. It also includes an endpoint that intentionally triggers a CORS error for demonstration purposes.

2. **Dice Roller Client:**  
   A static client website that consumes the Dice Roller API. It uses Bootstrap, Animate.css, and Font Awesome to create an appealing user interface with animations and interactive effects.

## Features

- Hosted on **Azure Web Apps** (API) and **Azure Storage Static Websites** (Client)
- RESTful API endpoints for dice roll generation and server wake-up
- Demonstration of intentional CORS failure (for learning purposes)
- Client interface with modern styling and animations
